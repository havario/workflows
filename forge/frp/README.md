[FRP][1] is a high-performance reverse proxy focused on NAT traversal, supporting protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and P2P communication. It enables you to securely and conveniently expose local services behind a NAT or firewall to the public internet through a relay server with a public IP.
